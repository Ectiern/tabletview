            <h2>Where it all started..</h2>
            <p>The first memory I have in the kitchen is cooking with my grandma for ThanksGiving. I always thought she was the best cook so I was so excited to be her helper for such an important meal! I think at that point I was only mashing potatoes, but ever since then I have enjoyed cooking and baking. Now, I find that baking is a big stress reliever for me, as it is a task that requires a lot of concentration. I also love to bake for my family and friends when they need something to cheer them up!</p>

            <h2>Where I am now!</h2>
            <p>I still love to bake! I have a few blogs I check frequently and I am always excited to try out a new recipe. Two of my roommates this year are vegan, so I have really enjoyed experimenting with gluten free and vegan baking! I think the concept sounds more intimidating than it really is, and I promise it still tastes great! Below showcases some of my most recent baked goods as well as some of my favorite things to make of all time!</p>
