        <h2>Start Small</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In order to start off on a good foot, start with the basics of cooking. Before trying to nail the perfect filet mignon, try making a solid chicken breast! If that's too daunting, try making a non-boxed mac and cheese! </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Get the Right Tools</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I can't express enough how important it is to have good tools in the kitchen! This includes knives, cutting boards, good oven-safe cookware, and appliances! My personal favorite appliance is an air fryer, as I have found it cooks things so perfectly without making cooking stressful!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Measure Your Ingredients Ahead of Time </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If you are nervous about trying a new recipe, try measuring out your ingredients ahead of time! This takes out so much of the stress. Instead of feeling rushed, you can remain calm knowing that you have everything all ready to go when you need it. This makes cooking a less stressful and more fun experience. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Challenge Yourself </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>At home, I know some of the best meals we have are when we just try to use what we have in the kitchen because we're too lazy to go to the store. It's a fun kind of challenge, and a lot of times makes a great meal! Why not test your limits and see what you can prepare out of what you have at home?! Who knows, maybe it will become a new staple meal!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Have FUN </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Most important above all, though, is to HAVE FUN! Experiment with new things, try new cuisines, see what you can do! Life wouldn't be the same if we all stuck to our comfort zone of Trader-Joes freezer food. Yes, sometimes recipes flop, but that's okay! Keep going and see what you can accomplish. Eventually, you may not even need a recipe!</li>
        </ul>
